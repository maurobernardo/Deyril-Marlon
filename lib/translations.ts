        subtitle: "Mapping climate vulnerabilities of slums by combining citizen science and earth observation technology",
        date: "2024 - Ongoing",
        overview: "SPACE4ALL is a project owned by the ITC- University of Twente and NWO (Dutch Research Council) that aims to unravel the climate vulnerability of slum communities in large and secondary cities by combining Citizen Science and Earth Observation methods. Earth Observation methods have the advantage of producing physical data for large areas and have shown their capability to map the physical aspects of slums. The project addresses the gaps by developing an innovative AI methodology by combining Citizen Science data and Earth Observation data with climate change data to locate hotspots of urban poor exposed to climate-related hazards (e.g., sea-level rise, storms, floods, extreme temperatures).",
        approach: "This novel approach had the main purpose the development and training of deep learning models in order to map the degree of vulnerability of slum communities to climate-related risks across both large and secondary cities in Africa, to enhance the precision and the flooding early-warning capacity of the model.",
        locations: "The project was conducted in African cities, namely Kisumu and Nairobi in Kenya, Accra and Tema in Ghana and at last Beira and Chimoio in Mozambique, in partnership with African institutions such as Data4MOZ and Sdi Kenya.",
        methodology: "The study was conducted in a participatory format where the citizens were able to point and map the vulnerable areas of the city to climate hazards, especially flooding, including its depth level of the floods for the latest events. The applied methodology allowed to gather local experts and stakeholders experience regarding the city's vulnerability to climate hazards through workshops with governmental and municipality institutions, NGO, private sector and community-based organizations that are engaged on climate action, WASH and urban planning.",
        contribution: "Under the Data4MOZ umbrella, as remote sensing analyst in the institution, my role for Space4All went from the field data collect and model validation, conducting field validation sessions in Kisumo (Kenya) together with ITC-University of Twente members and leading the activities in Beira and Chimoio (Mozambique), engaging the local communities and stakeholders for model validation sessions and gather subsidies by field observations, transect walks and mapping informal settlements.",

        date: "Oct. 2023 - Apr. 2024",
        overview: "Overview",
        overviewText: "The Greater Bazaruto KBA houses diverse marine ecosystems and because of its abundant biodiversity and diverse landscapes, this area holds significant ecological, economic, and societal importance, with tourism and fisheries serving as primary activities. This unique ecosystem sustains the livelihoods of local communities residing within the BANP and coastal communities in the mainland districts of Vilankulos, Inhassoro, and Govuro. However, the habitats and species face threats from illegal and unsustainable fishing practices, unregulated natural resource utilization.",
        objectives: "Therefore, due to aforementioned challenges and the imperative to enhance decision making for biodiversity conservation and community engagement, this research was conducted, aiming to i) geographically map locations that are regarded as crucial for providing essential resources and services for both island and mainland communities, ii) Provide a comprehensive understanding of how these significant sites are currently being utilized and by whom within the community, iii) Identify which types of usage are deemed sustainable and harmonious, as opposed to those that may generate conflicts, iv) Investigate and document the perspectives of local communities on the anticipated changes in these areas over the next decade, including alterations in distribution and utilization patterns resulting from climate change and other environmental factors.",
        districtLevel: "The study was conducted through a participatory spatial mapping in three different levels/categories, namely: Distrital level with the main stakeholder in natural resources management and biodiversity conservation and community level, including Communities Fishering Council (CCPs) within Vilankulo and Inhassoro districts. At district level, these workshops aimed to assess the current status of coastal planning and engage stakeholders in discussions regarding fisheries resource management across the province.",
        communityLevel: "At community level (inland) Participatory spatial mapping was conducted separately with CCPs of Vuca, Petane, Mukokuene, Tsondzo, Mangarelane, Nhagondzo and Chivambofrom Inhassoro district and Mangalisse, Mabandene, Mondego and Chichocane from Vilankulo district, where was gathered high-value information regarding coastal zoning in fishing contest and biodiversity and ecosystems conservation efforts carried out at the community level in order to maintain the fishing activity sustainable.",
        islandLevel: "The research covered the island's community within the archipelago. The communities from Magaruque, Benguera and Bazaruto islands provided extremely relevant information, given their exclusive dependence on marine resources as a means of subsistence, they revealed in-depth knowledge about coastal zoning in the region of the Greater BazarutoKBA, which enabled the creation of more precise maps with more in-depth details about fishing areas, tourism, mangroves, the occurrence of coral reefs, dugong and turtle routes, etc.",

        date: "2024 - Oct. 2025",
        overview: "Overview",
        overviewText: "The long-term goal of \"Land Use Intensity's Potential, Vulnerability and Resilience for Sustainable Agriculture in Africa\" (LUISA) is to build the resilience of smallholder farmers and pastoralists in Africa to land use intensification resulting from rapid population growth and climate change. LUISA will achieve this goal by developing a satellite-driven decision-support platform from which policymakers can deliver more effective and reliable carbon monitoring across Africa. Human Appropriation of Net Primary Productivity (HANPP) is a key environmental indicator that helps decision-makers to understand the drivers and consequences of land use intensification on carbon dynamics on a pixel basis over large areas.",
        approach: "The African land system is undergoing rapid changes and novel approaches are needed to understand the drivers and consequences of land use intensification, as well as the dependency, vulnerability and resilience caused by climate change. It is paramount to understand Africa's potential, vulnerability and resilience for a sustainable agriculture, defined as one that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially inclusive. Therefore, The LUISA Project developed and is implementing new methods, effectively linking and integrating modelling, satellite EO products (Sentinels, Explorers, Meteo missions, ESA-CCI) and dataset with in-situ, stakeholder-generated, social-economic data to advance the estimation of continental Africa potential, vulnerability and resilience for a sustainable agriculture.",
        useCases: "For in situ data collection to train the model, four use cases were developed in Senegal (Silvopastoral area), Mozambique (Beira Agriculture Growth Corridor), Ethiopia (Highland region of Lake Tana) and Uganda (Mount Elgon Agroforestry Zone).",
        mozambiqueCase: "For Mozambique Use case, Mixed research was conducted to collect data to support the remote sensing-based platform for biomass monitoring through HANPP. The qualitative research was based on consultations with stakeholders in the Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor, through guided interviews with key informants.",
        communityConsultations: "Additionally, Community consultations were carried out through focus group discussions separately with smallholder farmers and forestry operators.",
        quantitativeResearch: "Quantitative research was conducted with forestry operators and timber vendors to understand the dynamics of the forestry extraction and agricultural sectors in the region and the factors that contribute to the occurrence of biomass in the region. databases from private companies and from the provincial government were also gathered.",
        results: "This mixed approach allowed the development of a robust platform. with essential parameters to monitor the HANPP and biomass measurement at continental level.",

        overview: "SPACE4ALL é um projeto da ITC-Universidade de Twente e NWO (Conselho Holandês de Investigação) que visa desvendar a vulnerabilidade climática de comunidades de favelas em grandes e cidades secundárias combinando métodos de Ciência Cidadã e Observação da Terra. Os métodos de Observação da Terra têm a vantagem de produzir dados físicos para grandes áreas e mostraram a sua capacidade de mapear os aspectos físicos das favelas. O projeto aborda as lacunas desenvolvendo uma metodologia inovadora de IA combinando dados de Ciência Cidadã e dados de Observação da Terra com dados de mudanças climáticas para localizar pontos críticos de pobres urbanos expostos a riscos relacionados com o clima (por exemplo, subida do nível do mar, tempestades, inundações, temperaturas extremas).",
        approach: "Esta abordagem inovadora teve como principal objetivo o desenvolvimento e treino de modelos de aprendizagem profunda para mapear o grau de vulnerabilidade das comunidades de favelas a riscos relacionados com o clima em grandes e cidades secundárias em África, para melhorar a precisão e a capacidade de alerta precoce de inundações do modelo.",
        locations: "O projeto foi realizado em cidades africanas, nomeadamente Kisumu e Nairobi no Quénia, Accra e Tema no Gana e por último Beira e Chimoio em Moçambique, em parceria com instituições africanas como Data4MOZ e Sdi Kenya.",
        methodology: "O estudo foi realizado num formato participativo onde os cidadãos puderam apontar e mapear as áreas vulneráveis da cidade a riscos climáticos, especialmente inundações, incluindo o seu nível de profundidade das inundações para os eventos mais recentes. A metodologia aplicada permitiu reunir a experiência de especialistas locais e partes interessadas sobre a vulnerabilidade da cidade a riscos climáticos através de workshops com instituições governamentais e municipais, ONG, setor privado e organizações comunitárias que estão envolvidas em ação climática, WASH e planeamento urbano.",
        contribution: "Sob o guarda-chuva da Data4MOZ, como analista de sensoriamento remoto na instituição, o meu papel para o Space4All foi desde a recolha de dados de campo e validação de modelos, realizando sessões de validação de campo em Kisumo (Quénia) juntamente com membros da ITC-Universidade de Twente e liderando as atividades em Beira e Chimoio (Moçambique), envolvendo as comunidades locais e partes interessadas para sessões de validação de modelos e reunir subsídios através de observações de campo, caminhadas de transecto e mapeamento de assentamentos informais.",

É fundamental compreender o potencial, vulnerabilidade e resiliência de África para uma agricultura sustentável, definida como uma que é de baixo carbono, eficiente em recursos e socialmente inclusiva. Portanto, o Projeto LUISA desenvolveu e está a implementar novos métodos, ligando e integrando efetivamente modelação, produtos de EO por satélite (Sentinels, Explorers, missões Meteo, ESA-CCI) e conjunto de dados com dados socioeconómicos in-situ, gerados por partes interessadas, para avançar a estimativa do potencial, vulnerabilidade e resiliência da África continental para uma agricultura sustentável.",
        useCases: "Para a recolha de dados in situ para treinar o modelo, foram desenvolvidos quatro casos de uso no Senegal (área silvopastoril), Moçambique (Corredor de Crescimento Agrícola da Beira), Etiópia (região montanhosa do Lago Tana) e Uganda (Zona Agroflorestal do Monte Elgon).",
        mozambiqueCase: "Para o caso de uso de Moçambique, foi conduzida uma investigação mista para recolher dados para apoiar a plataforma baseada em sensoriamento remoto para monitorização de biomassa através do HANPP. A investigação qualitativa baseou-se em consultas com partes interessadas no Corredor de Crescimento Agrícola da Beira, através de entrevistas guiadas com informantes-chave.",
        communityConsultations: "Além disso, foram realizadas consultas comunitárias através de discussões de grupos focais separadamente com pequenos agricultores e operadores florestais.",
        quantitativeResearch: "Foi conduzida investigação quantitativa com operadores florestais e vendedores de madeira para compreender a dinâmica dos setores de extração florestal e agrícola na região e os fatores que contribuem para a ocorrência de biomassa na região. Também foram recolhidas bases de dados de empresas privadas e do governo provincial.",
        results: "Esta abordagem mista permitiu o desenvolvimento de uma plataforma robusta. com parâmetros essenciais para monitorizar o HANPP e a medição de biomassa ao nível continental.",
